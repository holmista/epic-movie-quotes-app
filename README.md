# epic-movie-quotes

Epic Movie Quotes is an app which enables users to create, update and view quotes from different movies. After you sign in with your email and password or with a google account you get redirected to a paginated news feed where all quotes from different users are displayed. You can also visit you profile page and update your avatar or username. You can also create a movie which will be added to your list of movies. If someone comments on your quote or likes it you will get a live notification of it. <br>Here is the [back-end repository](https://github.com/RedberryInternship/tornike-buchukuri-epic-movie-quotes-api.git)
